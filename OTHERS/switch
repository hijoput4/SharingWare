DON'T BUY IT. 😁


Seriously, if you don't have a really good reason for doing so, like having kids that want it no matter what or you can't upgrade your PC to play emulators, DON'T BUY IT.
Its worth 5 games, the rest of the library is a mix between anime visual novels and children games.

* Its a potato. Runs games at 30 fps most of the time.
* Ported games suck.
* Games cost hilarious amounts of money for what you get.
* Childish/Low quality library of games (those that are not visual novels which is 70% of the catalog). With exceptions known, Zelda and a couple more that may be childish, but still fun like Mario games. The other games are worse than a facebook game.
* "Adult" games are hentai visual novels, low quality porn games that ironically have more text than porn. Adult apparently means "porn" to the big N.
* Old Yuzu/Zuyu plays very well on PC and mods can let you play at 60 FPS or/and better resolutions. It plays the AAA titles (the around 6 games that are AAA) like the Zelda and Mario franchises.
* Its ridiculously expensive on some countries.
* Its just a trend that influencers keep alive. The console is a glorified cellphone with a low end nvidia chip on it.
* There are even some youtubers out there complaining about the quantity of trash porn games in the stores.

UPDATE: THIS APPLIES TO SWITCH 2, AS ITS THE SAME THING.
