I wanted to share this guy's experience since this happened to me on other sites and I think it happens to anyone. 
This is how things work for americans, they talk about freedom but then... here you have it.

This guy's discharge over a toxic community in a forum that later targeted him in reddit:
https://requnix.com/the-hidden-toxicity-of-the-grim-dawn-community-and-crate-entertainment

And this is his post mentioned there (check out the responses and how they downvote people with good feedback):
https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimdawn/comments/bthv84/grim_dawn_forgotten_gods_best_starter_builds_2019/


TL;DR: the guy simply posted a build for the game "Grim Dawn" in its official forum.
        He said that the guides existing there, where not properly written (and users confirmed it).
        What seemed to be random people started harassing him; later we get to know it 
        was moderators. Not happy with banning the guy and harassing him, they followed him
        to reddit to downvote and cancel him.


Welcome to modern life.
