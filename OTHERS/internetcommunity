Since reddit banned 'rantsandthoughts' (gaming reddit) because I posted how some idiot mod of a forum mocked
without any need or reason a guy asking a question I will now post these kind of things here in github.



I wanted to share this guy's experience since this happened to me on other sites and I think it happens to anyone. 
This is how things work for americans, they talk about freedom but then... here you have it.

This guy's discharge over a toxic community in a forum that later targeted him in reddit:
https://requnix.com/the-hidden-toxicity-of-the-grim-dawn-community-and-crate-entertainment

And this is his post mentioned there (check out the responses and how they downvote people with good feedback):
https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimdawn/comments/bthv84/grim_dawn_forgotten_gods_best_starter_builds_2019/


TL;DR: the guy simply posted a build for the game "Grim Dawn" in its official forum.
        He said that the guides existing there, were not properly written (and users confirmed it later).
        What seemed to be random people started harassing him; later we got to know they 
        were moderators. Not happy with banning the guy and harassing him, they followed him
        to reddit to downvote and cancel him.


Welcome to modern life.
