# LINUX IS SHIT in the state it is (and I don't have hopes for it to become better at this point). 
Not because I'm a brand fan of windows, not because I "love capitalism", not because I simply hate it because I use other OS...
Linux is objectively bad, its community is bad and there is no QoL in the design, it is an OS for hobbists that want
to spend immense quantities of time in fixing what should already be working. Linux is bad, its file system architecture is a mess, programs are all fragmented in system folders, good luck doing a backup, you have to triple check if a piece of hardware is compatible or not WITH EACH DISTRO, it is completely unstable, the dev community is as asshole-ish as in windows githubs trying to discourage issues by setting insufferable templates to be filled even for small stupid bugs, everyone is whining about poor linux users not having software but they don't move a finger to make it, the blame is always some ideologistic stupid story about devs not being paid. Also they hate wine even if they use it all the time because they don't have software. 

DO NOT MIGRATE if you are on Windows, no matter how bad the privacy thing gets, you can tame it with simplewall and other tricks, in linux this also happens and you cannot control it. Do not fall for preachers in reddit, do not believe them, linux is VERY LIMITED to the point of making a power user of Windows, want to go back desperately. 

I've lost all. I'm trying to figure out how to re-migrate back to windows 10. I have encrypted data, a lot. I need to reformat all my HDDs to NTFS again. We are talking about Terabytes of info.

If you are a casual pc user and have crappy hardware, you may want to try linux. If you don't expect much of it, it works like an android phone. 

__If you are a power user, DO NOT, and believe me, DO NOT, migrate to linux as it is a cage with good marketing.__ This sounds as ironic as the fact that I'm writing from a machine with linux right now. Leave the hype to noobs.


### Lack of software:
Turns out, that there is no software for linux. Yep, as you read it. Fanboys are spreading the lie that there are tons 
of softwares to choose from since years, but its a lie. You are restrained to a repository (for your distro) and outside it 
lies the danger of breaking the system. Programs that overwrite system files and conflicts of dependencies that are not 
called DLL's but are in a practical way, DLL's.

### BAD software:
Continuing with the above fact, there is the other issue: almost all software is being done by hobbists or amateurs.
You are in github, you know that amateur software can be pretty good sometimes, but my personal experience is that for linux
it is not. Things are horrendously designed, not to be used by common people but the developer himself; meaning simple QoL 
is not even on the table. Some software barely works, like "input mapper" or "cairo dock", software that works if you are lucky. 

### No alternatives:
There are no real alternatives for windows software. The alternatives are not up to even being called like that.
I'm surprised that linux nerds, being the sophisticated they are, cannot make a (((real))) mspaint clone to this day.
That brings us to Clones. Bad, horrible looking with scarce options, clones. The alternatives are not there so 
don't think you can do the same that you do in Windows. GIMP my ass.

### Unstability:
You reboot linux, and you don't know what will break at boot next time. Could be desktop apps not finding files anymore,
could be your GPU drivers being replaced by the default driver for no apparent reason, could be drivers updated and not 
working again, could be system updates breaking the system. Worked all day to make a feature work, only to find out
after a reboot, it doesn't work anymore. 

### Forced reboots:
Continuing the above fact, you will face hard-reboot situations very often. Windows did not suffer from this since windows
7 at least. If you use wine (of course you do!!!ðŸ¤£) you will face black screens with deadend situations that will not 
let you retake control of the computer. 

### Software to say "goodbye" to:
- Photoshop. You can run it in wine, but it runs like ass and cannot use video acceleration, and newer versions don't work.
- Topaz labs software. It doesn't run even on wine.
- Foobar2000. Works under wine, but if it is closed unexpectedly, it corrupts its databases so you must reset it. And I mean for example a normal shutdown while the app is still open will corrupt it.
- Paint.NET. No way of making it install or work.
- Docks (general). There is only one working dock in linux and its called "plank". It is so simple that its almost useless.
- Playnite. Doesn't run, dev says he will someday make a linux version.
- Bitlocker. This one is obvious, but it does not work under linux so BE CAREFUL when planning a migration.
- Icue - GHUB - peripherial software. If you bought a programable mouse and keyboard, bad news. "CKB-next" did a good job with their clone though.
- Macrorecorder. Particulary famous in this place.
- IDM (internet download manager) there is no real alternative, the clones have half the features and it doesn't download videos, also the clones struggle to intercept downloads.
- Teracopy (no alternatives that integrate with the os)
- many more.


### Ridiculous simple things become impossible:
Want to change your gamer mouse polling rate? call Torvalds himself to do it for you.
In linux there is no such thing as "simple". There is no dragging slider and persistent settings. No.
There is the terminal, arbitrary impossible-to-remember commands + arguments and lots of time to be lost 
trying to make the most simple stuff happen. And to make things funnier, the system will remind you that you
don't have permissions for anything other than moving files in your home directory and put red banners when
you use root. Psst!.. a system that can be broken so easily because of having root permissions is not what I 
call "robust"... reminds me of Windows 95 when you delete your system32 folder (and you can).

### The community is very arrogant and fanatic:
Do as they say or "@$#k you!". Do not dare to say linux is not at par with Windows. Preachers everywhere (the reason for this text).
Lies, all lies about the goodness of linux. Seasoned with "cool nerd guy" stereotype phrases and jokes.
"Simple" is in their mouth, trying to portray linux as very simple and easy. It is, if you only use 
spotify, instagram and steam. Fanboys insulting. Go to the "linux mint" forums and check a couple of posts there; most
answers only give shitty alternatives because what you want to do is always "invalid" and you have to do as they say.
Basicaly they will tell you what you want to do. And they quickly get offended. Yeah, very "libre".

### Everything becomes a rabbit hole:
You start with a simple thing to do, and soon you realize all the day has passed and you still can't do the simple thing.
Very contradictory with the legends that linux preachers talk about on reddit, where everything is simpler and better.

### Loss of control:
This is controversial, but it is true until you become one with linux. The problem is that linux is not privacy friendly as you
may have been sold. You see, if you install the "simplewall" clone (app firewall), which is "opensnitch", you will soon realize
very strange behaviours of the system. Not only because the calculator app shipped in linux mint connects to the IMF site when launching
it (yes, the International Monetary Fund), but because restricting network to apps can kill your system. Why? I don't know the 
technical details, but if you block networking to a system app, you may not boot your system again. Go figure. And here is the real
thing: funny enough, Windows is far more easier to restrict. In linux the apps want to connect to localhost always, go figure why (loalhost
is your own pc, or 127.0.0.1). Some people say that it is because linux resolves dns names before sending the requests, but I had
apps that are not supposed to even go to internet send requests to localhost. And if you deny it, they break.

### Wine / Proton are a cancer and a blessing:
They do enable Windows software to run ...mostly... but they are quirky and configuring each app takes at least 1GB space for
its profiles (called prefixes for some reason). So if you want to run a windows app that weights 1mb, you need a 1GB prefix for it.
Prefixes are not mandatory, you could install and run all your wine apps (-no you can't-) in one prefix, but when one fails, or the 
prefix gets corrupted (very common) you lose everything for ALL apps installed there, including savegames for the case of games.

### A system that requires emulation to run other OS software is a bad start point:
As said in the first point, there is no software for linux. The available is in 80% bad, not working, restricted in some way or 
crashes enough to want to avoid it. You will need to run wine. And it is a pain in the ass. Most of it requires long lines of text in the
terminal. It requires a lot of time and investigation for each app or game. It requires patience, time and work. And as point 4 here
says: everything could crumble the next update.

### Nvidia drivers don't work well:
Problems with screen tearing are a default. Enabling "force desktop composition pipeline" is a suicide: it puts your GPU on a constant
%20~30% use on "idle". Then the quirks; the cuda versions being overwriten and not working scripts come up and we wonder what the 
fu%@ happened. Well, point 4 is a constant.

### Irony/installing a narrative:
Turns out, most of the linux preachers (do not confuse with people just using linux that are objective) are mostly very simple users. They are happy with steam,spotify and access to instagram and discord. That's all for them. That is why they 
are so happy with linux and that's why they say everything in linux "is so simple" because THEY are very basic users. After all these years, linux fanboys laughted at windows users for being "dumb" or "basic" that "cannot open a terminal" and it 
turns out they are so short-minded that they encircled themselves in linux walls and try to defend their position at all costs even when they know windows is way more mature, stable and has way much more software available.

### A toxic community of trolls and whiners.
They are anchored on the idea of "somebody is the cultprit, but we are not". Everything that fails in linux, is somebody else's culprit. The lack of native software available for this platform, is the result of linux users thinking capitalism is the cause of developers not doing anything, they blame everything but themselves. You can imagine that this will go on forever with that excuse, right?. They all rest on wine to be able to run more or less decent software (made for Windows) but then they spit on wine because "it has bugs". Really, they hate it. These people are weird. If it wasn't for wine, Linux would be long forgotten.
Don't dare to point out that linux has a complete lack of software or anything like that (in fact, any criticism), because they will tell you the same story: "its because people do what they can if they are not being paid". EXACTLY... that is the issue, nobody moves his/her ass to develop software; but then they say Linux is the best option. Be careful with these liars.

### Things I've personally 'lost' after migrating:
- Topaz software.
- All games have problems with screen tearing and activating vsync makes it WORSE.
- No more Teracopy. All linux copy programs are utter shit. None of them can replace the default copy command unlike in Windows. I got corrupted files by using the default copy.
- Profiles for my mouse (logitech g604), linux has piper which is a piece of useless software. No more profiles for different games, since this crap can only manage internal memory and it does it wrong most of the times.
- Photoshop, using an old portable in which the menues get glitched.
- Paint.net. No graphics alternatives, they are the worst software that I've seen in a loooong time in general.
- Foobar2000 can't use multimedia keyboard keys, because wine doesn't support that. If it crashes, you have to delete its databases and start over with configs. See above ("crash" may be a normal system shutdown while its open)
- Everything in general is a mess; customization requires stupid amounts of time and its very limited. Changing normal settings is a pain in the ass because things break on the next restart. Simple stuff is horribly complicated in linux.
- Full of GUI glitches and freezes.
- Lost HDD space due to wine prefixes (70GB)
- Software library: there is simply no good software out there, while in windows I could just dive github and it was really easy. __WINDOWS HAS MORE FOSS SOFTWARE THAN LINUX!!!!__
- To upgrade MPV player you need to make a course and it has dependency conflicts.
- No more "simplewall".
- No more "clowd" for video and image screenshots.
- Unstability, the system is very prone to fail.
- Root operations make your life miserable, requiring extra steps and time lost.
- By default linux will make your boot times increase by the minutes if you use network drives or shares. This is because the dumb OS waits until the network is reachable before booting up. AGAIN, BY DEFAULT.


# IN THE END, IF YOU INSTALL LINUX, YOU ARE JUST INSTALLING A LAUNCHER FOR THE WINDOWS APPS (THAT WORK) BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE PROPER NATIVE SOFTWARE. 
LINUX IS PRONE TO DISSAPEAR IN THE FAR FUTURE AS WINDOWS IS ALREADY INTEGRATING WITH IT AND THE USERBASE IS SIMPLY NOT MOVING THEIR ASSES TO FIX IT AND ARE INSTEAD RELYING ON WINE FOR EVERYTHING WHILE THEY SOMEHOW HATE IT.
