Why are you still using the youtube propietary app? unless you have an apple device which has their own rules, 
you can just install firefox and its extensions: Ublock origins and sponsorblock (and many others that will help
you achieve what you do with "revanced" and other complex-time consuming apps that must be installed in a certain way
with certain packages that are not always easy to find etc etc.

1- Install firefox on your phone.
2- Correct all data sucking behaviours from firefox. (Yeah, the "champions of freedom" are now spying on you by default.)
3- Inside firefox go to [...] (tree dots menu) -> Extensions. At bottom, "search for more" -> Choose Ublock Origin,
   install it, then repeat for sponsorblock and any other extension you might want to personalize youtube on firefox.
4- Configure the extensions if you want or use the defaults, they work.
5- You can also create a "desktop shortcut" that will work as if you were opening the youtube app: 
   [...] (tree dots menu) -> Add to Home Screen


That's it. Enjoy youtube with all features and no complications. 




PRO TIP: ...and you can even play with userscripts with violentmonkey to truly personalize your experience.
