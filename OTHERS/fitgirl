Fitgirl repacks are SAFE. That¬¥s the first thing I want to make sure its clear.

After EMPRESS drama, fitgirl repacks are biased towards indie, low quality, or rather dumb/childish games. 
She started making some switch games repacks, but as you imagine, that is just putting a portable emu + rom, so no magic there.

Some of her repacks are abandoned, meaning you must update the game on your own (specially if it has some sort of cracked multiplayer like Battlefield 4), this makes people
on the comments section to share guides and links to other sites/patches/help guides that inevitably opens the door for bad intentions. Judge VERY well what links you will follow.
Telling you to "not follow any links" is just stupid, since we were searching exactly that in the first place in this case, but if you are a complete newbie *don't follow any links* üòê.

I've seen a message that she or her "staff"(?) put some time ago: https://fitgirl-repacks.site/tiny-tinas-wonderlands 

"When you see some DLCs are not working, this is due to you using a fucking 
stupid antivirus ‚Äì usually it‚Äôs Windows Defender. This useless piece of 
shit silently deletes crack files, that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt see those DLCs. 
Just restore files from the quarantine, then shut down this crap forever
and NEVER use antiviruses again. Use your brain, if you have one."

‚ö†‚ö†‚ö† DON'T FOLLOW THAT ADVICE!!!!!
Use exceptions to stop false positives, but never, ever, uninstall or disable your antivirus. There are hard viruses that install in way tha CANNOT BE CLEANED if they manage to infect your PC and you will need 
to format the HDD to get rid of it. Miners are the most usual.

Use Ublock or NoScript when visiting her site, since she has miners in her webpage that work while you browse (they don't install on your PC). This was said by herself some time ago and was clear about it. She uses them to get revenues in exchange
of her work (or at least, that's what she said).

EDIT 12/2024:
It seems she is also uploading porn games now, following the worlwide trend. Be careful if you have kids.
