    Use: https://github.com/SpotX-CLI/ for PC use.  -(no 320kbps).
    Use: https://xmanagerapp.com/ for android use.  -(no 320kbps). ‚ö† Note: It seems the app is broken. Downloading the modded binaries is impossible now. Something is wrong with their hosting.

[MY ADVICE](https://github.com/hijoput4/TheBubble/blob/main/OTHERS/spoti)

### 2- Youtube + ad blocker + sponsorblock (android & PC)

    Use: https://f-droid.org/packages/free.rm.skytube.oss/    -for android.
    Use: https://github.com/revanced/                         -for android.

### 3- Where do I download clean games?
       
    Use: https://cs.rin.ru/     -clean steam files, must apply steam emu; latest downloads/versions and obscure steam games available. This is the source for repacks 90% of the times.  
    Use: https://www.game-repack.site
    Use: http://dodi-repacks.site/
    Use: https://gog-games.to/   -or-  ONION (tor browser) http://goggamespyi7b6ybpnpnlwhb4md6owgbijfsuj6z5hesqt3yfyz42rad.onion/     -GOG games catalog. It was a good place, but recently got flooded with hentai games and visual novels, and no filter options üòï.
    Use: https://steamrip.com/     -Steam games pre-cracked and pre-installed. Its basically doing a "repack" of games from cs.rin.ru by applying the steam emu to them.
    Use: https://fitgirl-repacks.site/     -mostly indie osbcure, girly and dumb games. You 'may' find some AAA titles. Better use cs.rin.ru and goldberg emu.
    Use: https://forum.torrminatorr.com/    -mostly GoG games (good alternative to gog-games.to)
    Use: https://vsetop.org/games/     -Russian repacks on torrent
    Use: https://rlsbb.ru/category/games/     -Russian share of different repacks. Also has movies and other stuff.

### 4- Need to unlock DLCs on legit games or download Steam clean releases for manual cracking.
    
    ‚ö†üßÇ be careful, abusive teenager moderators.
    Use: https://cs.rin.ru/
    This forum is not designed to help you. It is designed to share tools and "clean" (not cracked) games, so don't participate in it and instead learn.
    
    Use: https://github.com/SteamAutoCracks/Steam-auto-crack to "manually" crack the clean games downloaded from cs.rin.

    ARL's are now banned in hours. Firehawk52 apparently abandoned its work and we cannot get any more ARLs.
    I'm sad to say that even if you get deemix working, it will do just for a couple of hours so I'm not 
    updating this entry anymore. Instead use one of the more laborious alternatives below. 
    I humbly recommend FLAC over mp3 to store music, because its noticeable increase in listening quality.
