Realpiracy is no more as reddit banned my user and deleted everything, this is the sibling. 
A heavily moderated sub about politics, geopolitics, privacy and other things that you won't be reading in the average news show.
A place free of DEI and LGBT, that tries to walk the thin "reason" line while exposing imperialism, privacy concerns and manipulation in these Orwellian times we live.

Not for the left. 

Not for the right. 

What is bad is bad, what is true is true.

### 3- Where do I download clean games?
       
    Use: https://cs.rin.ru/     -clean steam files, must apply steam emu; latest downloads/versions and obscure steam games available. This is the source for repacks.  
    Use: https://gog-games.to/   -or-  ONION (tor browser) http://goggamespyi7b6ybpnpnlwhb4md6owgbijfsuj6z5hesqt3yfyz42rad.onion/     -GOG games catalog. Check out https://github.com/masterofobzene/UserScriptRepo for the gog-games userscript.

    Other sites you can use:
    Use: https://www.game-repack.site
    Use: http://dodi-repacks.site/
    Use: https://steamrip.com/     -Steam games pre-cracked and pre-installed. Its basically doing a "repack" of games from cs.rin.ru by applying the steam emu to them.
    Use: https://fitgirl-repacks.site/     -mostly indie, girly and dumb games. You may find some AAA titles. Better use cs.rin.ru and goldberg emu. It is what she does after all but with a nice installer.
    Use: https://forum.torrminatorr.com/    -mostly GoG games (good alternative to gog-games.to) but you need an account.
    Use: https://vsetop.org/games/     -Russian repacks on torrent. Nowadays, its like fitgirl's page 😢.

    ⚠🧂 be careful, abusive teenager moderators.
    Use: https://cs.rin.ru/
    This forum is not designed to help you. It is designed to share tools (bypass steam mostly) and "clean files" (not cracked) games, so don't participate in it and learn instead.
    
    Use: https://github.com/KaladinDMP/ARMGDDN-Autocracker-OG-GSE to "manually apply medicine" the clean files games downloaded from cs.rin.
    OR use: https://github.com/SteamAutoCracks/Steam-auto-crack ⚠ BUGGED ON WINDOWS 10. Works on Windows 11.

### 5- I need console game ROMS

    Use: https://r-roms.github.io/   (⚠ check the "Nintendo Games" on the left because the index doesn't mention NES,SNES and other consoles but ROMS are there) - Nintendo DMCA Ninjas are taking down everything Nin-related.

    For Sony consoles: https://nopaystation.com/browse

    (you shouldn't have bought the over expensive potato, but suit yourself)

    Use: https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere  - Open source 'Ntendo' OS. 
    Use: https://github.com/HamletDuFromage/aio-switch-updater  - Updater app (I think it is outdated by now) Requires the console "liberated".

[MY ADVICE IF YOU STILL DON'T HAVE A SWITCH](https://github.com/hijoput4/TheBubble/blob/main/OTHERS/switch)

### 7- Need advanced tools for my switch games.

    Use: https://github.com/dezem/SAK    -good for changing formats of games from nsp to xci and vice versa.

### 8- Need switch firmwares.

    Use: https://darthsternie.net/switch-firmwares/

### 9- Where do I get a show or movie?

    FMHY is pretty much a list of moderate piracy. Don't expect much from them.
    Use: https://fmhy.net/videopiracyguide   -menu has much more links for other rather "light" piracy stuff.

### 10- Is it there an app for android TV that is like vanced?

    Use: https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext

### 11- Where can I download a specific program?

    Use: https://filecr.com 
    Use: https://lrepacks.ru

### 12- Need an app for android.
NOTE: always be careful when installing apps on your cellphone. Its targeted more than PC's for viruses and spyware.

    Use: https://www.apkmirror.com/  (not cracked apps)
    Use: https://apkcombo.com/   (not cracked apps)
    Use: https://forum.mobilism.me/   (cracked apps)

### 14- Need to download a video on the internet.

    Use https://filecr.com/windows/internet-download-manager/?id=5992240122 to install IDM. The program has a browser extension to detect streaming videos so you can download them.
    Use: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp (see .15)

### 15- Need to download a video or full playlist from youtube. (*Command line (CLI) app*)

    Use https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
    e.g. command (good for almost any site): 
    
    yt-dlp.exe --restrict-filenames -o "C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Downloads\%(title)s.%(ext)s" [https://YOUTUBE_URL]
    Change the "YOUR_USERNAME" for your real username.

    Use: https://tidal.squid.wtf/   (sometimes down)
    Use: https://music.binimum.org/ (sometimes down)

    
### 18- Where do I get ARLs for deemix?

    In short: Deemix doesn't work anymore unless you use your own paid credentials for deezer.
    ARL's are now banned in hours. Firehawk52 apparently abandoned its work and we cannot get any more ARLs.
    I'm sad to say that even if you get deemix working, it will do just for a couple of hours so I'm not 
    updating this entry anymore. Instead use one of the more laborious alternatives below. 
    I humbly recommend FLAC over mp3 to store music, because its noticeable increase in sound quality.
        
### 19- How can I download music in FLAC?
    Yes, some are the same than above. This entry will update with new sites when I find them.

    Want to mod your Switch games? (useful for changing UI input to Xbox or PS controller): https://gamebanana.com/search?_sOrder=best_match&_sSearchString=controller&_idGameRow=7617

### 27- Where can I download and play Minecraft for free?

    Use: https://github.com/rePublic-Studios/rPLauncher   ⚠ I don't know if multiplayer is possible or not with these versions.

NOTE: This could be called "an exclusive".

    Use: https://archive.org/details/macro-recorder-3.0.36-portable   - then download a filecr version (whichever as long as it has the BTCR "medicine" and use that to activate this version instead)
    

### 29- I need a working method to download spotify music

    Use: https://github.com/masterofobzene/spot2yt  Barebones spotify to youtube downloader. This one works but it doesn't grab all metadata. Also it can retrieve wrong song versions from time to time (live versions, remixes, etc).

### 33- Where can I get native linux versions of mainstream games?
NOTE: You shouldn't be using linux unless your hardware is not enough for a good old Windows 10. Linux became a "launcher" for Windows apps since it doesn't have proper software and never will. [Read](https://github.com/hijoput4/SharingWare/blob/main/OTHERS/linux.md)

    Use: https://archive.org/details/native-linux-games-collection   ⚠️ you will need to create an account at archive.org to see the contents.

# PRIVACY
---------------------------------------------------------
### 👁‍🗨 Minimal setup for privacy caring people to browse internet:

- [Get an app firewall](https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall/releases/download/v.3.8.7/simplewall-3.8.7-setup.exe). Not a firewall, an "app firewall". It lets you  give permission to individual executables to go to internet. A pop up will appear to ask you. TIP: unless you plan to play on multiplayer, DENY all requests for internet for all games you install, if you have problems you can always allow them easily. You will be scared to see how games are being used to get user data and try to connect even before the user accepts their terms.

- Use [Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/installation/) instead of Firefox. Don't use any other browser.

- Use [Ublock origins](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/).

- Stop using your real name on internet, duh!. 
Change passwords and usernames between sites (don't use the same 
always). Use disposable emails (down here in the list you will find free
 services).

- Only use open internet access points if you are in trouble and need internet connection for something particular.

- NEVER TELL GOOGLE MORE THAN IT NEEDS. Avoid following those "add your home" pop ups in google maps for example.

- NEVER TELL ANY OTHER APP MORE THAN IT NEEDS. For example your birthday in Telegram.

- AVOID FOLLOWING GOOGLE'S ADVICE ON SECURITY, 
if you can skip it, don't put your real phone nor any other data they 
ask you "for your security". The "security" hoax is used widely by all 
data gatherers worldwide.

- Change your DNS servers if you are still using the ISP ones (Internet Service Provider). [Here](https://docs.quad9.net/Setup_Guides/Windows/Windows_10/) is a nice guide by Quad9 free DNS service and [here](https://quad9.net/service/service-addresses-and-features/) is the list of available DNS's they have. There are others like [DNS.sb](https://dns.sb/dot/) to use DoT (DNS over TLS AKA encrypted DNS). Don't understand this? just follow the first link (guide) and second (quad9 DNS).

- Don't get comfy with AI. They are gathering 
surreal quantities of data. Don't give personal information, don't 
engage in chats with AI. Avoid falling into those "free nudify AI" ads, 
boys.


### 👁‍🗨 Advanced setup for privacy caring people to browse internet:

- Stop using Google products when possible / use a burner account. The most important, is to stop using their mail services; they store all your emails and "read" the contents. It's in their terms of use if you ever read them. You have free privacy mail alternatives like [Proton](https://proton.me/mail) or [Tutanota](https://tuta.com/).

- Do not upload pictures of yourself / family on internet. Use privacy caring services to only share to close relatives (not adviced though). ASK YOUR MOM TO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES OF YOU ON HER FACEBOOK, its a usual backdoor.

- Remember: if you are not using a [VPN service](https://protonvpn.com/free-vpn), your real IP tied to your billing info is logged on EVERY site you visit. Do not pay for any VPN service without reading their privacy statements; Mullvad and Proton are said to have pretty good privacy standards and don't keep logs of your activities. This is important, think all your browsing will be tied to billing information, CHOOSE WISELY AND CAREFULLY.

- It is adviced to use [Cookie containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) and set your Librewolf to delete all cookies on exit by default. Add the required sites to keep cookies to the exception list using the "manage exceptions" button in privacy tab. Container extension will isolate each site cookies so they can't see other site's cookies (to steal more user data and profile you). [This extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/container-script/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) does the same and is more advanced so I recommend this one only to powerusers.

- Do not use any Windows Hello, face recognition or any other biometrics from Microsoft if you are not sure of what you are doing (don't use them if you are not being pushed to do so). Avoid using any Microsoft accounts and don't log them in your personal PC.

- Avoid uploading avatars if possible.

- On Windows, it is a good practice to set your username to something completely generic like "PC", "USER", "Computer". While this may seem stupid and obsessive, it turns out that with the flourish of github and similar coding sites and FOSS, logs and questions are flying everywhere with usernames being ACTUAL REAL NAMES sometimes. Sometimes you need to share an error message that happens to have your user home folder in it for example "C:\Users\Rick_Patter\appdata\roaming\someapp\log.txt". You don't want to be Rick Patter, do you?.
