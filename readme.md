 [📵Why you should NOT use your smartphone if you have access to a PC or laptop.](https://youtu.be/VFns39RXPrU)

[Reddit: RealPiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealPiracy/comments/1alxtpv/landing_page_where_are_you/)

Please read the landing page to know what to expect there, which is mostly NOT piracy but politics.


[Reddit: RantsAndThoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/rantsandthoughts/comments/19dz5kf/landing_page/)

The "say your stuff" corner. If you want a place that is not a "product marketing hub" like in any other reddit brand-page, filled with fanboys where you get your posts deleted because you made criticism, rant about products or trends; don't want LGBT content, don't want anime content or 'pROn', this is your place. You can post your thoughts, as random as they can be and review games and post links to download them, doesn't matter if they are old or new; just be honest for others that are tired of youtubers 'always good' reviews. So; games, reviews, complaints and thoughts go here.


[Reddit: Sharingware](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sharingware/comments/1c804uv/landing_page/)

For your 🏴‍☠️ needs. Share and see if something is useful. As usual, no LGBT, "pROn", anime or memes.
